* Project Description
   * Drugs and Info will be a mobile-friendly, modern website that allows users to search for prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Our basic functionality as of right now is to list the drug name, description, and possible side effects. The front page will also display popular New York Times articles related to health drugs.
* APIs Used
  * New York Times API
  * OpenFDA API
* Rough Breakdown of Tasks
  * Phase one will be to make the website with basic functionality. Avonlea Haymart will focus on the website design and front-end development. Noah Neighbours and Dominic Griffis will focus on back-end development and API usage. We will all collectively do API research and build the connection between front-end and back-end. This includes checking code for bugs and monitoring its efficiency.
